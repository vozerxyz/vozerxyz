# Welcome to my Codeberg profile
My name is Valentin and i'm a student from Turkey, i'm interested in coding, UNIX and free software. I'm learning Java for school (OpenCV, i refuse to learn Python. I have nothing against it, i just refuse to learn it.) and my second priority is learning Ruby, you can see my skills below.
